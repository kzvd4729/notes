--> number of ways to make n using k non negative integers (n+k-1)C(n).
--> burnside lemma: burnside lemma solves counting problem where rotation,
reflection,symmetry comes into account. there can be 0,90,180,270 degree
rotation and reflection along x or y exis and so on. then total distinct counting
by ommiting rotation,symmetry is the average of all counting.
