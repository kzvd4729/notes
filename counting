--> number of ways to make n using k non negative integers (n+k-1)C(n).
--> burnside lemma: burnside lemma solves counting problem where rotation,
reflection,symmetry comes into account. there can be 0,90,180,270 degree
rotation and reflection along x or y exis and so on. then total distinct counting
by ommiting rotation,symmetry is the average of all counting. 
(how many permutation doesnt change after 0 degree ratotaion)+(how many 
permutation doesnt change after 90 degree ratotaion)+(how many permutation doesnt 
change after 270 degree ratotaion)+ .... /number of group.
--> catalan number: 1/(n+1) * (2n)C(n)
